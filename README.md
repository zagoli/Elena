# Elena Calendar for Seniors

Elena is a straightforward web application designed as a calendar specifically tailored for seniors.
I made it to revise my basic Angular skills.
It features a minimalistic interface that allows users
to insert a link to a public calendar (ICS file) to display
the events of the current day (in landascape orientation).
The event list refreshes every 30 minutes.
