# Elena Calendar for Seniors

Elena is a straightforward web application designed as a calendar specifically tailored for seniors.
I made it to revise my basic Angular skills.
It features a minimalistic interface that allows users
to insert a link to a public calendar (ICS file) to display
the events of the current day (in landscape mode otherwise it is even uglier).
The event list refreshes every 30 minutes.
Click on the date to toggle fullscreen mode.
